In the IT area we hear more and more about cloud offerings for both general public and trade services (with for example cloud computing).

KeepAlert, Bordeaux's specialist in Internet brands monitoring, has to process and store data about several thousand websites per day for his business.

To stand out from the competition, we must not only be as comprehensive as possible in the detection of the disputed sites but also always offer more features.

This make the material needs increasingly important for an optimal functioning of the platform;
so it's now necessary to rethink the way it's constructed.
If we don't, we take the risk of not being able to meet the expectations of our customers regarding the features and delivery in the long term.

With their public cloud offerings, net giants like Microsoft, Google and Amazon make available some of the equipment needed for their activity,
and the accumulated know-how in terms of infrastructure, maintenance, security and data centers, all at reasonable prices.

The use of these clouds allows access to a virtually unlimited number of servers (the limit is so high to reach that in a case of normal use it's very unlikely).

These characteristics encourage the use of horizontal scalability to meet increasing workloads.

These are all characteristics that currently encourage migration from parts of corporate IT environments.

But, if these specificities bring benefits, they also bring risks that must be controlled.

Throughout this document, I'll tell you the story of the migration of part of our Online Brand Monitoring Platform to the Amazon's Cloud.

This story includes:

 * The discovery of the Amazon's Cloud and a (small) part of the many services they offered,
 * The discovery of technologies suited to horizontal scalability,
 * Changes induced in our platform to use these new capabilities,
 * The financial impact of this migration,
 * The strengths and weaknesses of this new solution.

While explaining these points, the answers to some questions are provided.

 > What should we learn from this experience? \newline
 > Is the Cloud profitable in our case ? \newline
 > Are our expectations in terms of computing capacity and storage fulfilled ? \newline
 > What about controllable risks ? \newline
 > How is shaping the future of this type of service ?
